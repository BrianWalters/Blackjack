# Blackjack - A CSS Toolkit

Blackjack is a collection of mixins, functions and helpers written in Stylus to make your front-end development easier and faster.

## Why should I use this?

A minimum level of work is always required when building CSS for a web site or application. Every project you work on will need things such as resets, helper classes, and a whole mess of other parts. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, Blackjack gives you a starting place for your CSS. It's engineered to be re-usable across projects and easy to drop into any Stylus codebase.

## How do I use this?

The `source` directory contains the good stuff. Use Stylus's `@import` to pull in `blackjack.styl` to your project. Open it and comment out the parts you don't want, then you're good to go!
